## FPS/Graphics Guide
NOTE: Keep in mind these settings were based on my personal performance is likely very inaccurate. Additionally, messing around with some settings in raid can cause some bad visual glitches, so be aware of this before reporting any bugs
#### In game graphics guide
- Resolution likely doesn't matter too much as it's always going to render to the quality of your headset or what SteamVR is set to, but it's posssible lowering the resolution to as low as possible may net some frames.
- Anti aliasing should be off or on FXAA - No FPS difference noticed between the two, and other options cause bad visual glitches
- Resampling should be off/1x otherwise it may cause visual glitches
- DLSS and FSR don't work properly so turn them both off
- HBAO - Looks better but takes a massive hit on performance - off gets about around 10-20 fps increase
- SSR - Low drops frames by around 2-5, ultra by about 5ish. I don't personally notice any visual improvements but it seems like if you have it on, you may as well go to ultra
- Anistrophic filtering - No real FPS difference
- Sharpness at 1-1.5 I think any visual gain falls off after around 1.5+
- POST FX - Turning it off gains about 8-10 FPS in some situations, or does nothing in others

#### Additional FPS guide
- Check out the [TrueLive](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2454-truelive/) Donuts+Swag configuration by MaTSix which aims to follow the AI spawns as close to live Tarkov as possible, which helps reduce CPU load throughout raids and can result in a solid FPS gain.
- Thanks to yurinin for finding this: By downloading and setting up [this](https://github.com/RavenSystem/VRPerfKit_RSF) version of the VR performance toolkit, then going into the config file and setting the method to CAS, renderScale to 30 and sharpness to one, then using the SteamVR resolution settings you can scale up your resolution to much higher than normal to achieve a higher fidelity for no loss in FPS (atleast in my case)

- **groundzeroday**: Check out his work at [hexler.net](https://hexler.net/)
- **Havviks**: Thanks for making the trailer, go watch his videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HAVVIKS)
- **MaTSix**: Offered a lot of helpful ideas which greatly decreased the jankiness of the mod

## **Get in contact**
For reporting bugs or recommending improvements, go to either the SPT discord or Flat2VR discord servers, if you want to reach out to me personally, you can send me an email at cybensis@protonmail.com

## **Development Environment Setup**

If you wish your own changes to the mod or want to check it out for whatever purpose, follow the below steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: This can either be done by downloading the source code through the GitHub page or by using the below command
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cybensis/SPT-VR.git
2. **Open it up in your IDE:** I've only ever used Visual Studio for development so I would recommend using that. Opening the .sln file will open up Visual Studio which should already be configured to build without isssue
3. **Make your changes and build:** After making your changes, to test them simply go to the *Build* dropdown menu at the top of Visual Studio and go *Build Solution*
4. **Add the build to your SPT installation:** After building the mod, you should find the new file under *bin/Debug/TarkovVR.dll* or *bin/Release/TarkovVR.dll* depending on whether you've built a debug or release version, then in your SPT installation, replace the *BepInEx/plugins/sptvr/SPT-VR.dll* file with your new one and you should be good to go.
