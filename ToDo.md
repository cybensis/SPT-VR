- Arms no longer perform most of the sprint and jump animation
- Added an extra slider for scope smoothing

THINGS TO DO IN NEW UPDATES
- Might need to change the left hand world interaction laser
- Find a way to disable FSR permanently as it causes errors
- When swapping from left to right hand/vice versa  in the hideout overview it doesnt swap the laser
- Fix BTR
- Looking up on factory messes with lighting
- Selecting a weapon then putting it away in the hideout makes it so you cant reequip one in left handed mode
- Also need to change the position of the mag ammo count

GETTING WEAPON IN LEFT HANDED MODE TO NOT BE INVERTED - Don't think its possible, the animations just don't work
- Need to look into the visual effects when walking into barbed wire or getting hurt as it completely blacked my screen and caused the highlighting mesh to stick to my screen again, might just be a setting though, if it is make sure it is disabled permanently
- Try setting the scale of the base of the weapon itself to -1,1,1, it flips the hands around but this just might need some rotating around
-	Looked into it and if I set the hand bone scale to -1 -1 1 it orients correctly but is slightly off from the gun, to change its position it would involve changing the right hand IK marker but even updating it in update and lateUpdate doesn't work as it seems the aniimator on the weapon supercedes it no matter what so figure something out with that maybe or just checkout eft.player.method22 for the hand setting position 
	- __instance._markers[0].localPosition += new UnityEngine.Vector3(0.11f,0.03f,0.01f);
	- __instance._markers[0].localEulerAngles += new UnityEngine.Vector3(-30,80,-40);
	- __instance._markers[1].localPosition += new UnityEngine.Vector3(-0.065f,0,0);
- - Refactor the blockCrouch and blockJump stuff, shouldn't need them at all, just block joystick when menus are open and in the jump input handler just check for if player is crouched

- Aiming with a scope on lighthouse, probably other maps, makes grass despawn
- UI was bugging out when I received at item from a trader and I think pressed B to go back which overlayed the preset menu on top of other menus and the Escape from tarkov logo on the main menu was black, also going presets then clicking the hideout button, maybe menu button too will keep the presets menu there
- Issue with there being a radius of light around you, then everything beyond that radius has a shadow or is just darker. - Disabling the DistantShadows GBuffer made it go away, so its something to do with near shadows?
